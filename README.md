**TCP**:

This folder contains Java classes for a basic TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) communication setup. The "TCP_Server.java" file represents the server side, while the "TCP_Client.java" file is the corresponding client implementation. These classes facilitate reliable, connection-oriented communication between the server and client, ensuring data integrity and order.

**UDP**:

The UDP (User Datagram Protocol) communication folder includes two essential Java classes: "UDP_Server.java" for the server and "UDP_Client.java" for the client. UDP offers a lightweight, connectionless communication approach, making it suitable for scenarios where real-time and low-latency data transfer are crucial. The classes provided here showcase a simple yet effective UDP communication setup for seamless interaction between server and client.
