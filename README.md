In this repository, explore basic Java implementations for TCP and UDP communication.
Inside the src folder, you will find two folders:

**TCP**

This folder contains Java classes for a basic TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) communication setup. The "TCPServer.java" file represents the server side, while the "TCPClient.java" file is the corresponding client implementation. These classes facilitate reliable, connection-oriented communication between the server and client, ensuring data integrity and order.

**UDP**

The UDP (User Datagram Protocol) communication folder includes two essential Java classes: "UDPServer.java" for the server and "UDPClient.java" for the client. UDP offers a lightweight, connectionless communication approach, making it suitable for scenarios where real-time and low-latency data transfer are crucial. The classes provided here showcase a simple yet effective UDP communication setup for seamless interaction between server and client.
